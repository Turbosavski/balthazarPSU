# BalthazarPSU 

1. module BalthazarPSU is a combined battery charger, buck-boost coverter and stereo power amplifier. 

2. module BalthazarKeyboard is a simplified a bit ergonomic computer keyboard with "diy" approch. I updated the keyboard to have some more geometric consistency. 

3. module BalthazarIO is a simple USB2.0 four-port hub for the internal devices: keyboard and touchpad, webcam and optional audiocard. 

So-far no prototype was built yet - these are preliminary files to be checked in practise.

Some philosophy is in the .pdf files included. The newest is no. 3.

CERN Open Hardware Licence CERN-OHL W V.2.0
Version 2.0 of the CERN-OHL introduces three variants of the licence – strongly (S) reciprocal, weakly (W) reciprocal and permissive (P) – which aim to address specific constraints caused by different collaboration models currently used in open-hardware projects. 
The first two variants mean that if any product is made using an open hardware design, the design of that product, including any improvements or modifications, should be made available under the same licence as that of the original product. Permissive licences do not impose this condition.
